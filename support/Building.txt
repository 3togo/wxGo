The following is needed for building wxGo

- wxWidgets (version 2.8.11.0 or version close to it.)

- SWIG

Download wxWidgets from www.wxWidgets.org. I have worked with the stable
release which was 2.8.11.0 at the time but this code should very likely
work with the most recent stable release.

Build wxWidgets from source. 

On the windows platform do that with MinGW/MSYS.

TODO: Detailed wxWidgets build instructions

After building wxWidgets make sure you get at least the 'Minimal' example
working.

Download the latest SWIG version from www.swig.org. Go support for SWIG
is still undergoing development. Especially for the Windows platform
I needed to apply a patch for better dll support.

That meant I had to build SWIG from source file on Windows which required
some additional tools installed like bison, ed.

The SWIG version you want is latest from SVN repository and then apply the
patch done by Wei Guangjing.
Look for the 'swig go support windows port' thread on golang-nuts.
I have included the patch file with my wxGo repository in the support
directory. In future releases if SWIG this will likely not be required.

TODO: Detailed SWIG build from source instructions

I also needed to make some changes to the Make.pkg file in the Go
directory so it was able to link the SWIG dll with all the required
library files. The changes file is in support/Make.pkg. These changes
may also no longer needed when better swig/go/windows support is
available.

If you got this far then you are almost there.

To build the wxGo library:
cd wx
make install

To build the examples apps just go to the relevant directories and type make.
