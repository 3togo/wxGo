This is the source code for wxGo a Go wrapper of the wxWidgets library.

The actuall wxWidgets source code is not included and will need to
be downloaded separately.

The wrappers are created using the SWIG tool.

There are currenly still some patches/tricks required to get a 
propper build going. Mostly releasted to SWIG support on windows.

Read support/Building.txt for information on how to get it all going
on windows.
